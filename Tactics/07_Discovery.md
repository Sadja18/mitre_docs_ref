### TA0007

### Description

**The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.**

- Discovery consists of techniques an adversary may use to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. 

- These techniques help adversaries observe the environment and orient themselves before deciding how to act. They also allow adversaries to explore what they can control and whatâ€™s around their entry point in order to discover how it could benefit their current objective. 

- Native operating system tools are often used toward this post-compromise information-gathering objective.
