### Description 

**The adversary is trying to steal data.**

- Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network.

- Once theyâ€™ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it.

- This can include compression and encryption.

- Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission
