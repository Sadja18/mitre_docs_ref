Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network.

- Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations.

- There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services.

- Services such as *`Windows Remote Management`* and *`VNC`* can also be used externally.

- Access to **Valid Accounts** to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through *`credential pharming`* or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.

- Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.

- Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesnâ€™t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.
